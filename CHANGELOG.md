  - Prompts changed slightly 
 
- Version 4.4.1:
  - Print a user-friendly error when extra trees have taxa not in main trees.

- Version 4.4.0:

- Version 4.3.1:
  - Output consensus bootstrap tree as well
  - Output support only for internal branches
  - Fix default seed number to 692
  - Root all output trees *arbitrarily* on one taxon

- Version 4.3.0 (**command-line options changed!** Notice some commands are not backward compatible!):
  - Performs bootstrapping (`-b`, `-r`, `-g`, `-s` added)
  - Uses a library for argument parsing. We had to change some of the option names (exact version: `-xt` --> `-x`, extra trees: `-ex` --> `-e`).
  - Does not output the number of quartets satisfied by each branch; that information was not interpretable. 

- Version 4.2.1:
